            <div class="accordionContent">
                <p>Before using this activity in class (or at home), go through the activity
                    once to make sure it works correctly on your computer(s) or devices.
                    Please be aware that this game is in HTML5, which is not stable across
                    browsers and platforms.
                </p>
                <p>Your computer or devices will need to have some sort of sound output. Either
                    speakers or headphones will work well. The majority of this activity has voice
                    audio. We highly recommend headphones or ear buds in a classroom setting.
                    Students with hearing impairments can read the text at the bottom
                    of the screen. If you are having difficulty hearing the audio,
                    check the audio settings on your computer or device.</p>
                <p>The worksheet is highly recommended for this activity and is available below under
                    ‘Assessment Tools.’ If a teacher prefers not to use the worksheet,
                    he/she should make this clear to the students, as the game refers to
                    the worksheet numerous times.
                </p>
                <p>Students in the target grade-range will take approximately 35 - 40
                    minutes to complete the entire activity.

                <p>Why did Kristie involve a business consultant and another friend with a business when
                    it came time to build the budget? Why wouldn’t one resource be enough?</p>
                   <p class="pText"> <span class="pHead">Answer:</span> There was no existing company
                       that was exactly like the Multidot
                company Kristie was starting. For this reason, it made sense to check with
                others with similar companies to see what they did. In reality,
                a person starting a new business would most likely check with 5-10
                sources. It’s always best to be thorough.
                </p>
                <p>Why would Kristie budget more for sales and marketing than many start up business do?
                </p>
                <p class="pText"> <span class="pHead">Answer:</span> She researched this enough to know
                    that many companies were running out of money for sales and marketing using the
                    lower percentage. So she learned from their mistakes and budgeted a
                    higher percentage of the income.
                </p>
                <p>Why did Jessica ask to have the results left on her desk of all
                    the trial experiments to determine the best proportions of materials?</p>
                <p class="pText"> <span class="pHead">Answer:</span> Again, it’s best to be thorough.
                 Jessica is the expert and, while the numbers seem fairly straightforward,
                she might see something that we missed. She might interpret the numbers
                a different way, based on her knowledge and expertise.
                Most scientists choose to look at raw data when it is available to see
                if they interpret the data the same way as others do.
            </p>
                <p>At the end of the game, Jessica and Kristie were talking about
                    selling Multidot and starting a new company around another
                    one of Jessica’s discoveries.
                </p>
                <p>Do you agree with this plan? What are your thoughts on that idea?
                </p>
                <p class="pText">In favor of selling is the fact that a small company with
                    2-3 employees will have a hard time keeping up with big pharmaceutical
                    companies that sell this type of thing internationally.
                    Also, those big pharmaceutical companies can buy Jessica’s dots,
                    study them, change or improve them and then begin selling them in
                    competition with Jessica. Against selling is the fact that it took a lot of time
                    and work to start the company. It will take a lot of time and work to
                    start another company. Is there some compromise path that could be
                    taken? Maybe Jessica works for a large pharmaceutical company and retains
                    rights to her discoveries??
                </p>
                <p class="pText">If they were to sell their company, research how they would go about doing that.
                    Do a search for ways to value a business and then estimate what you think the company
                    might be worth. Keep in mind that they are just beginning to sell their product,
                    so they don’t have any income, exactly. They do have office and lab equipment as assets.
                    They also have the patent of Jessica’s discovery as a big asset and the knowledge of
                    how to increase production to commercial levels. But the company hasn’t really
                    proven itself as a high income producer. After researching this question, would
                    you recommend Jessica and Kristie sell their company or sell right to the patent
                    or stay on the path they started down, to market the dot themselves?
                </p>
                <p class="pHead">Writing activity</p>
                    <p>Write a marketing ‘pitch’ for Jessica’s discovery.
                    How would you convince hospitals and doctors to purchase the Multidot
                    in the shortest amount of words, covering the advantages to her Multidot over
                    her competitor’s dots?

                    Either speakers or headphones will work well. The majority of this
                    activity has voice audio. We highly recommend headphones or ear
                    buds in a classroom setting. Students with hearing impairments can
                    read the text at the bottom of the screen. If you are having difficulty
                    hearing the audio, check the audio settings on your computer or device.

                <p>When Jerome was troubleshooting the reason the manufacturing line stopped,
                    why did he spend so much time checking fuses, talking to Hailey and looking
                    at the timing when he already thought it was the limit switch?</p>

                   <p class="pText"> <span class="pHead">Answer:</span> Troubleshooting involves checking
                       a variety of possibilities before narrowing in on a problem. For most companies
                       and industries, there is almost always a recommended set of steps to figure out why
                    something is wrong. Jerome was checking EVERYTHING to make sure that
                    there were not multiple reasons why the line stopped, and, as he
                    mentions several times, it’s always best to be thorough.
                </p>
                <p>What are some advantages to troubleshooting the way Jerome was doing it?</p>

                <p class="pText"> <span class="pHead">Answer:</span> Because of Jerome’s thoroughness,
                    he is certain that the reason the line stopped cannot be anything other than the
                    limit switch. Also, by checking fuses, talking to Hailey, checking timing and
                    generally taking a good look at all the pieces and parts of the line, he is able
                    to see what might need maintaining or replacing BEFORE it stops the line and
                    costs the company money. He can be more proactive instead of reactive in his job.
                    He’s also able to determine if Hailey knows her job or he could recommend to her
                    supervisor that she might need more training.
                </p>
                <p>If it is important to get the line started again and expensive ($3,000 - $4,000 an hour,
                    or $50 - $66 per MINUTE the line is not working using the Edheads' figures in the game)
                    when it stops, why did Jerome take so long to troubleshoot the problem?</p>

                <p class="pText"> <span class="pHead">Answer:</span> While it may or may not have
                    been true in this instance, Jerome and his supervisors know that skipping steps
                    and missing problems is even more expensive in the long run. In this case, if he
                    went straight to the limit switch and ignored timing when there really was a problem,
                    then starting the line up again could have caused problems that impacted machinery,
                    damaged engine blocks, or even hurt the line operators. Jerome checked everything
                    carefully, even though it took time, so that when the line was started up again,
                    he could be confident that everything was working at it should have been.
                </p>
                <p>Why does Jerome carry around a list of tolerances for various types of switches and
                    equipment? Why would a company that produces switches even take the time to test
                    and research that information and come up with recommended tolerances?</p>

                <p class="pText"> <span class="pHead">Answer:</span>As we saw after installing
                    the new limit switch, not everything is perfect all the time. The new switch
                    was 5 degrees off the horizontal (the arm would only travel from 90 degrees down
                    to 5 degrees instead of going all the way to zero degrees). It’s important when
                    working in a manufacturing plant (or almost any job), to know what is
                    ‘good enough’ and what is not. The new limit switch, while not perfect,
                    is good enough to get the job done and keep the line moving. If Jerome
                    had spent time trying to make the switch perfect (travel down to zero degrees
                    all the time), he would have cost the company quite a bit of money without
                    changing anything of significance. In other words, the return on that investment
                    of time would not have been worth anything to the company and would have
                    prevented the line from checking more engine blocks. Most careers and types
                    of businesses have standards and/or tolerances they need to meet.

            </div>
            <div class="accordionContent">
                <p>Jerome was required to write a succinct summary of what occurred on
                    section E12 of the line when it stopped, but we never saw what was in his report.
                    Have your students summarize what happened in their own words, with a goal of
                    being both thorough (what might other technicians need to know?) and brief,
                    without skipping anything that might help the company. As a further extension,
                    have them justify what they have included and what they have excluded from their summary.
                </p>
                <p>This activity is about manufacturing lines. People in the US don’t think about
                    manufacturing as being a ‘good’ career choice any more, but it is a
                    great career! Modern manufacturing is sometimes referred to as
                    ‘skilled manufacturing.’ Assign your students a research
                    project to determine:
                <ul class="accordionList">
                <li>What sorts of skills are needed on manufacturing lines today?

                    long does it take to get these certifications?
                </li>
                <li>What is starting pay for someone with a job like Hailey’s as a manufacturing
                    line operator? (our research indicates over $50,000 a year with a high school diploma!)
                </li>
                <li>What is starting pay for someone with a job like Jerome’s as a manufacturing technician?
                    (our research indicates over $70,000 a year with a 2 year associates degree!)
                </li>
                <li>Skilled manufacturing jobs exist all over the country. What are some examples
                    of companies or plants near your school that have such jobs? What do they

            <div class="accordionContent">
                <p>Safety, quality and cost are aspects of the manufacturing line that this company
                    (or any manufacturing company) emphasizes almost every day with every employee.
                    Ask your students to give you examples of each of these aspects that they
                    saw in the game. </p>
                <ul class="accordionList">
                    <li><span class="pHead">Safety:</span> bump cap, flame retardant tech uniform, safety glasses are all good examples,
                        but so are processes like lock out/tag out and checking the line before starting it.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="pHead">Quality:</span> checking the measurements of the cylinders with the robot and also
                        checking the robot’s calibration with the hand-held measuring device;
                        also the way Jerome went about troubleshooting the problem and then
                        fixing it – he checked everything carefully and was very thorough.
                    </li>
                    <li><span class="pHead">Cost:</span> Jerome and Hailey were both aware of time passing and the need to get the line
                        moving again. This is an example of their cost awareness. They know the longer
                        the line wasn’t working, the more expensive it got for the company. It's hard
                        for any employee to 'see' money being wasted so some don't perceive of
                        ‘down time’ as an expense, or don’t work hard to reduce lost time.
                        However, those expenses are real and they get passed on to the consumer.
                        The best employees, like Jerome and Hailey, want to insure their own
                        success and that of the company they work for and strive to prevent and/or
                        reduce down time whenever possible.

                    Either speakers or headphones will work well.</p>
                <p>Students in the target grade-range will take approximately eight to ten minutes
                    per room working individually or in groups of two to three. Students seemed
                    to spend more time and have more fun working in small groups. If time is
                    limited, you may want to consider assigning a certain number of rooms
                    or specific areas for the students to experience. The House is
                    identifying simple machines and the Tool Shed is identifying the simple
                    machines that make up compound machines.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>Students have the ability to print their scores
                    after finishing all four rooms in the House and the Tool Shed.
                    Teachers should make certain they know which printers the students’
                    computers are set to print to.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>During testing, most students finished each room at roughly the same time.
                    All the students printing at the same time could potentially back up in a
                    very long print queue or clog the school’s network. Teachers may want to
                    consider having students call out when they want to print, limiting the
                    number of rooms students will print scores for or having students
                    use multiple printers.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the printable score sheet is to give teachers an idea
                    of how students are performing within the site and what their knowledge
                    level is. Many students prefer to go through a room two to three times in order
                    to increase their scores. Teachers may choose to ask that students only print
                    the scores from their first time through a room.
                </p>
                <p>After students use the site, teachers may want to discuss with their class why
                    certain objects were simple machines. Leading questions such as “Would the fan
                    blades work as well if they were flat instead of tilted?” will get students
                    thinking about WHY the blades of a fan can be considered inclined planes.
                    Many students will ask questions about the same objects and this can generate
                    excellent classroom discussion about the characteristics of the various
                    simple machines.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="accordionContent">
                <p>Students with math skills lower than geometry and trigonometry can do this activity,
                    but we recommend providing some of the answers for them to aid them in completing the activity.
                    Teachers are the best judge of their own students’ abilities, so we leave the decision to
                    them as to whether this activity is appropriate.  </p>
                <p>the decision to them as to whether this activity is appropriate.
                    Before using this activity in class (or at home with your kids) go through the activity once to make sure
                    it works correctly on your computer(s).</p>
                <p>Your computer(s) will need to have some sort of sound output. Either speakers or headphones will work well.
                    The majority of this activity has voice audio. We highly recommend headphones in a classroom setting.
                    Hearing impaired students can turn on the subtitles by clicking the audio off button in the lower
                    right corner of the screen.   If you are having difficulty hearing, check the audio settings on your computer.
                    Also check to see if the audio logo in the bottom right hand corner of the activity screen is on.</p>
                <p>We also strongly recommend that students use a real mouse, as the touch pads on lap top computers are more difficult
                    to use for this activity and slow students down significantly.</p>
                <p>Calculators are recommended but not required.  If you and/or the students do not have calculators,
                    the Windows operating system does provide one.  This can be found in different areas
                    on different computers.  You might want to let your students know where they can find the Windows
                    calculator at the start of the activity.</p>
                <p>Print/copy the Crash Scene Report document (13 pages) before using the activity with your class.
                    Click here to print Crash Scene Report.  We also recommend having two students work together,
                    one using the computer and the other using the Crash Scene Report.  If you use the activity this way,
                    you will need one copy of the Report for every two students.</p>
                <p>Students in the target grade-range will take approximately 40 to 70 minutes to complete the entire activity working in groups of two.
                    However, you can also omit parts of the activity as outlined below.
                    This will shorten the time taken in class. If you are going to take two class periods to complete the entire activity,
                    you can guide students back to where they stopped by encouraging them to use the ‘skip intro’
                    buttons and to hit the ‘continue’ button to bypass calculations and measurements already performed.
                <ul class="accordionList">
                    <li>For science classes that want to emphasize science process skills rather than math skills,
                        the teacher can provide the answers to the measurement and math questions.
                        This will significantly speed up the Calculations and Forces section or allow
                        your students to skip it entirely.  Click here to print answers to the Worksheet
                        section of the Crash Scene Report print out, and then substitute this page for page
                        9 of the print out.
                    </li>
                <li>For math classes wanting to emphasize the math without spending the time on the science skills,
                    start at the Calculations and Forces section.  You will need a drawing of the crash scene to provide to students,
                    in addition to the Crash Scene Report prinout.  Click here for sketch of the crash scene.   Only print pages 8 and
                    9 of the Crash Scene Report print out, available above.  The other pages will not be needed.</li>
                <li>For a public safety message for students in prom and graduation seasons, teachers can skip as many sections of
                    the activity as they see fit.  We do strongly recommend that students do the Forces section of the activity.
                    To do this section alone, print out the Worksheet section of the Crash Scene Report print out with the
                    answers to the calculation section already completed, but the Forces section still to be filled in.

            </div>

            <div class="accordionContent">
                <p>For an assessment tool, teachers may want to collect the completed Crash Scene Reports from groups of students.
                    These should indicate if students completed the assigned activity sections.

                <p>After students use the site, additional in class discussion questions
                    (which can also act as assessment tools) can be asked:
                <ul class="accordionList">
                <li>What was the purpose of measuring all the skids and gouge marks when only certain distances were used
                    in the calculations?  (This will hopefully get students thinking about WHY various steps were taken.
                    You never know what evidence may turn out to be crucial later and you don’t want a defense
                    attorney to get a bad driver off).</li>
                <li>What building, tree or other object in/near this school is equivalent in height to the fall that the driver
                    of Unit 1 would have had to make in order to equal the forces exerted on him in this accident?
                    (You will have to figure this out for yourself, but a Google search for named buildings in Ohio,
                    for example, produced their height in meters and feet in almost all searches.
                    Heights of buildings the students might be familiar with in other areas:  Eiffel Tower,
                    Paris, France = 276 meters or 986 feet.  Empire State Building, NY = 381 meters or 1250 feet.
                    Chrysler Building, NY = 319 meters or 1046 feet.  Space Needle, Seattle, WA = 184 meters or 604 feet.</li>
                <li>The driver of Unit 2 was given a five year sentence for vehicular homicide (more serious than vehicular
                    manslaughter) after being convicted by a jury.  The jury determined that the driver of Unit 2 was
                    acting in a reckless manner without considering the safety of others.  Do your students agree with this verdict?
                    This is a good time to have them consider that speeding can impact more than just the driver and the passengers
                    in the car that is speeding. </li>
                <li>Are there any public safety or corrective measures that should be taken to the road,
                    intersection or surrounding areas as a result of this accident?  (Students might
                    recommend moving utility pole, trimming back vegetation more regularly or putting in stop lights/or
                    flashing lights to indicate the potential danger of the intersection). </li>

            <div class="accordionContent">
                <p> <strong> Logically, what is the best way to proceed with this investigation?</strong> <br>
                    Start from the final resting place and trace skids and marks back to point of impact</p>

                <p><strong>It is fairly clear that the back tires of Unit 2 did not leave skid marks on the raod.  Why do you think that is the case? </strong><br>
                There tires were most likely still rolling normally, therefore would not leave skid marks.</p>

                <p><strong>Having seen the location and relative positions of the cars after the accident, what do you think this small mark might be? </strong><br>
                This is a skid resulting from the right rear tire of Unit 1 being pushed west.</p>

                <p> <strong>Why are we rounding down and using the minimum post-collision speeds?   </strong><br>
                So that a defense attorney can’t argue that we increased the speed by rounding up.</p>

                <p> <strong>Is it likely that Unit 1 stopped at the stop sign? </strong> <br> Yes</p>

                <p> <strong>Is there any evidence that the driver of Unit 2 applied his brakes before impact?  </strong><br> No</p>

                <p><strong>Were there obstructions in the road or obstructions to sight lines that could have contributed to this crash? </strong> <br> Yes</p>

                <p><strong>What was the approximate distance that a west bound driver, such as the driver of Unit 2, should have
                been able to see a car entering the intersection as Unit 1 did?  </strong><br> 260 feet.</p>

                <p><strong>Tire analysis of the vehicles indicates that:  All tires on both vehicles appeared to be in acceptable condition.
                Analysis of the Crush Evaluation for Unit 1 indicates:  The car met required safety standards for protecting the passengers.
                The driver of Unit 2 reported that he was going 55 mph.  Do you agree with this statement?  </strong><br> No</p>

                <p><strong>If you were to charge one of the drivers with a violation, which driver would it be?  </strong> <br>Driver of Unit 2</p>

                <p> <strong>If you had to say that there was one primary contributing factor to this accident, what was that factor?  </strong> <br>Excessive speed</p>

                <p> <strong>If there were lesser contributing factors to this accident, what would you say they were?  </strong> <br>
                Utility pole and vegetation blocking view of other traffic for both drivers.
                Two of the three people in Unit 1 died within seconds of the accident.
                The third died shortly thereafter.  There was some blood on the scene, but not enough
                to account for the deaths.</p>

                <p> <strong>What killed these three people?  </strong><br> The force of the collision was sufficient to damage internal
                organs and impair brain function.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="accordionContent">
            <p>A new golf course was built in Florida. The golf course was built over some existing marshes,
                which in Florida requires the builder of the course to create more marshlands somewhere else.
                These newly created marshlands, called mitigation areas (mitigating, or making up for the loss
                of wetlands), are required to be monitored twice a year to see that they are created correctly
                and that the newly created wetland is growing and progressing toward offering the same ecological
                function as the wetlands that were destroyed. This monitoring is conducted by qualified wetland biologists.
            </p>

            <p>At nine of the ten marshland mitigation areas of this golf course, the wetland biologist finds good growth
                and progression toward the goal of reaching the same ecological function. Marsh grasses are growing and there
                is good coverage of plants, and animals like crabs and herons can be seen. However, in the 10th area, there
                is only one plant visible, no animals, and it is not clear why. The wetland biologist must determine what
                the problem is and solve it to get the marshland mitigation area to grow and function like the others.

                <p>
                    Wetland biology is a growing area within the fields of biology and the biological sciences.
                    Biology is the study of all life – plant and animal – and how they react with their environment.
                    Wetland biology is about the relationship between a wetland environment and the plant and animal
                    life that lives there. They are often called upon to determine how healthy and ecologically
                    functional certain wetlands are. They can be called upon to test water and soil, conduct surveys of
                    animal and plant life, or conduct formal monitoring over time.  Formal monitoring involves establishing permanent,
                    fixed locations in which to assess the percent coverage of certain plants. Formal monitoring involves taking photos,
                    generating charts and graphs and comparing the growth or health of the area over time.
                    Informal monitoring might involve a simple check to see if the area is alive and determining
                    if the area is relatively healthy, given age and circumstances surrounding the area.

                    <strong> Education or skills required:</strong> The minimum education required to become a wetland
                    specialist is to complete a bachelor's degree in science majoring in ecology or
                    a similar discipline. To progress a career as a wetland specialist a masters or Ph. D. is required.

                <p>Although all the grades listed above can benefit from this lesson and have corresponding
                    Ohio science standards (fourth and seventh grades have the best correlation),
                    the most appropriate grade levels for this activity in reading and skill level are grades 6 and 7.
                    However, a strong class of fourth graders can most likely benefit from the activity as well.
                    The fourth-grade life science standard strongly correlates to the lessons to be learned here.
                    Be sure to simplify the lesson as needed. (See: “Hints for simplification” below.)
                </p>

                <p>For grade seven or possibly grade six, you may want to make the lesson a bit stronger by using the weather
                    data chart, for instance, or changing the cause of the blockage to something more complex.
                    You would want to avoid the words fresh water and brackish water to describe the mitigation areas
                    and let them discover for themselves which areas fall into those categories by searching through and
                    interpreting the data. Feel free to use the charts and tables at your own discretion to match your
                    students’ skills more appropriately.</p>

                <p>One side note at this point might help clarify the nature of what environmental scientists and,
                    indeed, all scientists do that is important. Scientists must explore all avenues when
                    they are attempting to solve a problem. Just as a medical doctor must rule out what the patient
                    is not suffering from to successfully diagnose what ails the patient,
                    scientists must eliminate certain data and conditions to competently reach a conclusion.
                </p>

                <p>In this exercise, students may come across data that only helps to rule out what is NOT causing
                    the problem or may not be very useful at all. In a case like this, students may complain of
                    unnecessary work or research that is a waste of time. The best response is to remind students
                    that designers of activities like this one often include more data than is necessary to solve
                    the problem, because the career they are studying often faces challenges such as this.
                    They may not be able to solve real-life problems by only looking for data that points to a clear solution,</p>

                    The table in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th columns represents the data for each type of water (ocean water,
                    brackish water, and fresh water).  The data in the fifth column is data collected and recorded
                    for area 10 at some point during the observation period.  Each line of information represents a
                    different parameter or component of the water tested such as salinity, temperature, and pH.
                    It only makes sense to explain each parameter if students ask questions about them or want
                    to know what the data is measuring. In that case, we have provided simple explanations for some of the tougher terms below. </p>

                <p>Some of the lines of data will help students pinpoint what is happening at area 10. Some will not as we explained earlier.
                    For example, the temperature of the water does not indicate what type of water is present at area 10. However,
                    students may notice that the pH of the water can only indicate one of three types of water: fresh water.
                    The other two (ocean and brackish water) are normally too high to indicate fresh water. </p>

                <p> Turbidity, salinity and electroconductivity also show that the water in area 10 is most certainly
                    fresh water. Another parameter that does not help in determining the type of water is dissolved oxygen.
                    The data could represent any of the three water types.

                <p class="pText">Dissolved oxygen (DO) is the amount of oxygen that is present in water.
                    Water bodies receive oxygen from the atmosphere and from aquatic plants. Running water, such as that of
                    a swift moving stream, dissolves more oxygen than the still water of a pond or lake.</p>

                <p class="pText">Turbidity is the amount of cloudiness in the water. This can vary from a river
                    full of mud and silt where it would be impossible to see through the water (high turbidity),
                    to a spring water which appears to be completely clear (low turbid- ity).</p>

                <p class="pHead">Salinity</p>
                <p class="pText">	Salinity is the dissolved salt content of a body of water.
                    It is a strong contributor to conductivity and helps determine many aspects of the chemistry
                    of natural waters and the biological processes within them.</p>

                    The reason that the conductivity of water is important is because it can
                    tell you how much dissolved substances, chemicals, and minerals are present
                    in the water. Higher amounts of these impurities will lead to a higher conductivity.</p>

                <p>The first photograph above shows the general appearance of wetland areas 1-9 in the study.
                    The second and third photos represent wetland area 10. Students should be able to
                    note that area 10 does not resemble areas 1-9 in several ways. First, areas 1-9
                    have much more plant growth than in area 10. Secondly, we notice that the tidal
                    inlet from the ocean via another wetland into area 10 is blocked by a bulldozer
                    (this can be changed to storm debris for older students).  Area 10 also has much more
                    open water than wetlands 1</p>

                   <p> Based on this information, students can see that area 10 is an area of concern
                       but also predict what might causing the problem. If brackish water or ocean
                       water cannot enter the wetland due to the blockage,
                       then wetland area 10’s water data will not be the same as the
                       other wetland areas. Due to rain and seepage from fresh water
                       sources in the nearby vicinity, the water in wetland area 10
                       should reflect the data of fresh water in key parameters.
                       This discrepant data can be found in the table.

            </div>

            <div class="accordionContent">

                <p>We would suggest one of two ways to approach the data overall. One way that may work
                    especially well for younger students is to create a slide or overhead of the table
                    and photographs and display it on a projector for the whole class.  The class could be
                    divided up into small break-out groups to discuss their findings after the whole-class session. </p>

                <p> Another scenario that especially works well with older student is to divide the class
                    into groups of three to five students to analyze the data and reach a conclusion they
                    will later present before the other groups. It helps even further to suggest that each group
                    represents an interested party or parties that have a stake in the outcome of the findings. </p>

                <p> Groups could represent, for instance, members of city council, the local tourist association,
                    residents who live in the vicinity of area 10, the local media, and others.  </p>

                <p> Findings could be presented still representing each group with suggestions and debate to follow.
                    In this way, a degree of social and civic interaction can occur to raise the stakes and implement more realism.
